  Abstract                 = {Skyrmions are topologically protected field configurations with particle-like properties that play an important role in various fields of science. Recently, skyrmions have been observed to be stabilized by an external magnetic field in bulk magnets. Here, we describe a two-dimensional square lattice of skyrmions on the atomic length scale as the magnetic ground state of a hexagonal Fe film of one-atomic-layer thickness on the Ir(111) surface. Using spin-polarized scanning tunnelling microscopy we can directly image this non-collinear spin texture in real space on the atomic scale and demonstrate that it is incommensurate to the underlying atomic lattice. With the aid of first-principles calculations, we develop a spin model on a discrete lattice that identifies the interplay of Heisenberg exchange, the four-spin and the Dzyaloshinskii-Moriya interaction as the microscopic origin of this magnetic state.},

  Abstract                 = {The quantum coherent coupling of completely different degrees of freedom is a challenging path towards creating new functionalities for quantum electronics. Usually the antagonistic coupling between spins of magnetic impurities and superconductivity leads to the destruction of the superconducting order. Here we show that a localized classical spin of an iron atom immersed in a superconducting condensate can give rise to new kind of long range coherent magnetic quantum state. In addition to the well-known Shiba bound state present on top of an impurity we reveal the existence of a star shaped pattern which extends as far as 12 nm from the impurity location. This large spatial dispersion turns out to be related, in a non-trivial way, to the superconducting coherence length. Inside star branches we observed short scale interference fringes with a particle-hole asymmetry. Our theoretical approach captures these features and relates them to the electronic band structure and the Fermi wave length of the superconductor. The discovery of a directional long range effect implies that distant magnetic atoms could coherently interact leading to new topological superconducting phases with fascinating properties.},

  Abstract                 = {Unconventional superconductivity induced by the magnetic moments in a conventional spin-singlet s-wave superconductor is theoretically studied. By choosing the spin directions of these moments, one can design the spinless pairing states appearing within the s-wave energy gap. For example, with the non-collinear spin configurations, both \$p\_\{x\} + p\_\{y\}\$-wave and \$p\_\{x\} + i p\_\{y\}\$-wave like states can be realized. The nodes of the energy gap and the zero energy flat band of Majorana edge states exist in the former one, while it is found that chiral Majorana channel along the edge of the sample and the zero energy Majorana bound state at the core of the vortex appear in the latter case.},

Here, we report on an ultrathin magnetic film in which individual skyrmions can be written and deleted in a controlled fashion with local spin-polarized currents from a scanning tunneling microscope. An external magnetic field is used to tune the energy landscape, and the temperature is adjusted to prevent thermally activated switching between topologically distinct states. Switching rate and direction can then be controlled by the parameters used for current injection. The creation and annihilation of individual magnetic skyrmions demonstrates the potential for topological charge in future information-storage concepts.},
