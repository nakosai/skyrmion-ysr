@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="\label {footnote:Rotation} Note that for the case of a spin-singlet SC given by Eq.~(\ref {ham}), the Bloch and the Neel skyrmions are equivalent since they can be related by a continuous $\pi /2$-rotation around the $z$-axis in the spin space $U = \protect \qopname  \relax o{exp}(-i\pi \sigma _z/4)$. In the presence of either the spin-triplet pairing or the spin-orbit interaction, the effects of the two types of skyrmions are different."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="We expect that a different spatial dependency of azimuthal angle (\ref {conf}) will not change the results significantly."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="The elegant multipole expansion captures the salient features of the problem. Because of its simplicity, we use the multipole approximation even beyond its formal domain of validity: $R<p_F^{-1}$ and $R\ll \xi _{sc}$. In the end of the paper, we present an exact numerical modeling and find a close agreement with a multipole analytical treatment."}
