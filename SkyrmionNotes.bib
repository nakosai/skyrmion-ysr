@FOOTNOTE{Note1,key="Note1",note="Note that for the case of a spin-singlet SC given by Eq.~(\ref {ham}), the Bloch and the Neel skyrmions are equivalent since they can be related by a continuous $\pi /2$-rotation around the $z$-axis in the spin space $U = \protect \qopname  \relax o{exp}(-i\pi \sigma _z/4)$. In the presence of either the spin-triplet pairing or the spin-orbit interaction, the effects of the two types of skyrmions are different."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note2,key="Note2",note="We expect that a different spatial dependency of azimuthal angle (\ref {conf}) will not change the results significantly."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note3,key="Note3",note="The domain of applicability can also be extended to $p_F^{-1}<R\ll \xi _{sc}$ with some modification of the theory."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note4,key="Note4",note="Although Eq.~(\ref {energy}) suggests that the SBS states may go inside the actual gap for large enough $S_0$, i.e. $|E^\pm _{\protect \rm  SBS}|<\Delta -S$, the multipole approximation of a skyrmion (\ref {vr}) is no-longer valid in this regime and, thus, does not give a reliable estimate of the SBS energy. In practice, by performing a numerical modeling, we never observe the SBS peaks inside the actual spectral gap, i.e. in the window of energies $|E^\pm _{\protect \rm  SBS}|<\Delta -S$."}
@FOOTNOTE{Note5,key="Note5",note="The inverse $I_\psi ^{-1}$ is commonly referred to as the inverse participation ratio."}
